The plant identification algorithm is based on a dichotomous key that associates genetic taxonomy and leaf shape morphology. The functionality of this application is dependent on both a camera image input and a person's sense of sight and feel.

Development of my GPS application skills includes: HTML, JavaScript, serial COM Port interface, object oriented VB.Net, and GPS serial string parsing.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The interactive tablet E-Book, book library database,  web conferencing app is a social prayer/meditation application which serves as an e-book library, LAN chat room and forum, interactive touch screen tablet, and teleconferencing tool.

The plant identification algorithm is based on a dichotomous key that associates genetic taxonomy and leaf shape morphology. The functionality of this application is dependent on both a camera image input and a person's sense of sight and feel. I used the following skills in developing my plant identification application: C#, Sql, MySql Database, plant biology taxonomy, image detection, EmguCV, front-end/back-end software development, and user interface design.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The tablet GPS app I developed is a cross-platform mobile device which inputs GPS signals from a USB COM port and displays the users current position, altitude, and speed. This application is not dependent on Internet signals. There is an additional celestial navigation modular component feature which is  currently under construction, which will be added as a plugin. Development of my GPS application skills includes: HTML, JavaScript, serial COM Port interface, object oriented VB.Net, and GPS serial string parsing.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The interactive tablet E-Book, book library database,  web conferencing app is a social prayer/meditation application which serves as an e-book library, LAN chat room and forum, interactive touch screen tablet, and teleconferencing tool. This device is plug and play, provided that a dedicated server is actively online on a shared network. Multiple users can log in and out in a shared event experience and influence each others' experience by changing the environment content. This App uses  ASP/WCF, C#, MySql, ADO.Net, Networked Conferencing, chat room techniques, E-Book, Database, TCP/IP, front-end/back-end development, language localization, and plug and play networking.</p> <p class=\"tab\"><span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.attn}}</span>, thank you for taking the time to read and consider my cover letter for employment with <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.name}}</span>.

The plant identification algorithm is based on a dichotomous key that associates genetic taxonomy and leaf shape morphology. The functionality of this application is dependent on both a camera image input and a person's sense of sight and feel.

Development of my GPS application skills includes: HTML, JavaScript, serial COM Port interface, object oriented VB.Net, and GPS serial string parsing.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The interactive tablet E-Book, book library database,  web conferencing app is a social prayer/meditation application which serves as an e-book library, LAN chat room and forum, interactive touch screen tablet, and teleconferencing tool. This device is plug and play, provided that a dedicated server is actively online on a shared network. Multiple users can log in and out in a shared event experience and influence each others' experience by changing the environment content.

It is free, so you can check it out yourself at AcreValue.com.  It is one of the most trafficked sites in Ag, and it is used by everyone ranging from farmers to landowners to bankers to auctioneers.  </p>\r\n<p>We also build farm management software, which helps professional farmers run more efficient businesses and make better decisions on their farms.  It encompasses everything from deciding which types of crops will be the most profitable, managing their team and the crop during the growing season, all the way through harvesting and selling it at the end of the year.  This software is used by many of the most professional and successful farms in the country: over 250 farms and 2M acres at this point.  Our customers for this software are typically 4th or 5th generation farms who have been successful enough that they have grown from just a husband and wife to teams with maybe 10 or 20 full-time employees, and our customers grow crops ranging from corn and soybeans to potatoes to almonds.  </p>\r\n<p>We work really closely with our customers, and everyone ends up spending time on the farm solving problems with customers.  Both of our products have been very successful: at this point, Granular is a little over 3 years old and we are a little over 80 people spread out mainly between our HQ in San Francisco and our second office in Champaign, IL.</p></div>\n</div>"

The plant identification algorithm is based on a dichotomous key that associates genetic taxonomy and leaf shape morphology. The functionality of this application is dependent on both a camera image input and a person's sense of sight and feel.

This application is not dependent on Internet signals. There is an additional celestial navigation modular component feature which is  currently under construction, which will be added as a plugin. Development of my GPS application skills includes: HTML, JavaScript, serial COM Port interface, object oriented VB.Net, and GPS serial string parsing.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The interactive tablet E-Book, book library database,  web conferencing app is a social prayer/meditation application which serves as an e-book library, LAN chat room and forum, interactive touch screen tablet, and teleconferencing tool. This device is plug and play, provided that a dedicated server is actively online on a shared network. Multiple users can log in and out in a shared event experience and influence each others' experience by changing the environment content.

The plant identification algorithm is based on a dichotomous key that associates genetic taxonomy and leaf shape morphology. The functionality of this application is dependent on both a camera image input and a person's sense of sight and feel. I used the following skills in developing my plant identification application: C#, Sql, MySql Database, plant biology taxonomy, image detection, EmguCV, front-end/back-end software development, and user interface design.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The tablet GPS app I developed is a cross-platform mobile device which inputs GPS signals from a USB COM port and displays the users current position, altitude, and speed. This application is not dependent on Internet signals. There is an additional celestial navigation modular component feature which is  currently under construction, which will be added as a plugin. Development of my GPS application skills includes: HTML, JavaScript, serial COM Port interface, object oriented VB.Net, and GPS serial string parsing.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The interactive tablet E-Book, book library database,  web conferencing app is a social prayer/meditation application which serves as an e-book library, LAN chat room and forum, interactive touch screen tablet, and teleconferencing tool. This device is plug and play, provided that a dedicated server is actively online on a shared network. Multiple users can log in and out in a shared event experience and influence each others' experience by changing the environment content. This App uses  ASP/WCF, C#, MySql, ADO.Net, Networked Conferencing, chat room techniques, E-Book, Database, TCP/IP, front-end/back-end development, language localization, and plug and play networking.</p> <p class=\"tab\"><span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.attn}}</span>, thank you for taking the time to read and consider my cover letter for employment with <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.name}}</span>.

The plant identification algorithm is based on a dichotomous key that associates genetic taxonomy and leaf shape morphology. The functionality of this application is dependent on both a camera image input and a person's sense of sight and feel.

This application is not dependent on Internet signals. There is an additional celestial navigation modular component feature which is  currently under construction, which will be added as a plugin. Development of my GPS application skills includes: HTML, JavaScript, serial COM Port interface, object oriented VB.Net, and GPS serial string parsing.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The interactive tablet E-Book, book library database,  web conferencing app is a social prayer/meditation application which serves as an e-book library, LAN chat room and forum, interactive touch screen tablet, and teleconferencing tool. This device is plug and play, provided that a dedicated server is actively online on a shared network. Multiple users can log in and out in a shared event experience and influence each others' experience by changing the environment content. This App uses  ASP/WCF, C#, MySql, ADO.Net, Networked Conferencing, chat room techniques, E-Book, Database, TCP/IP, front-end/back-end development, language localization, and plug and play networking.</p> <p class=\"tab\"><span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.attn}}</span>, thank you for taking the time to read and consider my cover letter for employment with <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.name}}</span>.

As a <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{desirability.applicationidentity}}</span>. <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{desirability.abilityarray}}</span>. <span class = \"highlighterDiv\">{{desirability.knowledgearray}}</span>. </p> <p class=\"tab\">I am seeking to diversify my technology portfolio and develop a career as a <span class = \"highlighterDiv\">{{desirability.applicationidentity}}</span>. I have developed a variety of program applications which perform tasks directed at social networking, GPS, weather, document preparation, databases, audio processing, telecommunications networking, and agriculture. I have labor, retail, mechanic, and legal employment experience and graduate school leadership in databases and robotics. I posses  the adaptability to apply the skills needed to work as a <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.jobname}}</span> within <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.name}}</span>.</p> <p class=\"tab\">Within the last year I have developed the following technology applications: a plant identification and imaging identification application, a Windows 8-10 tablet satellite global positioning system without wi-fi app, and an interactive tablet e-Book with an independent serve library database and  A web conferencing app. These projects were an opportunity to express my understanding and ability to perform a variety of different philosophical approaches, intellectual processes, and techniques which have value in a variety of technical markets.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The Plant Identification and Imaging Identification Assistant is a Windows OS application that performs comprehensive plant identification that is based upon human observations and traits of a plant specimen. The plant identification algorithm is based on a dichotomous key that associates genetic taxonomy and leaf shape morphology. The functionality of this application is dependent on both a camera image input and a person's sense of sight and feel. I used the following skills in developing my plant identification application: C#, Sql, MySql Database, plant biology taxonomy, image detection, EmguCV, front-end/back-end software development, and user interface design.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The tablet GPS app I developed is a cross-platform mobile device which inputs GPS signals from a USB COM port and displays the users current position, altitude, and speed. This application is not dependent on Internet signals. There is an additional celestial navigation modular component feature which is  currently under construction, which will be added as a plugin. Development of my GPS application skills includes: HTML, JavaScript, serial COM Port interface, object oriented VB.Net, and GPS serial string parsing.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The interactive tablet E-Book, book library database,  web conferencing app is a social prayer/meditation application which serves as an e-book library, LAN chat room and forum, interactive touch screen tablet, and teleconferencing tool. This device is plug and play, provided that a dedicated server is actively online on a shared network. Multiple users can log in and out in a shared event experience and influence each others' experience by changing the environment content. This App uses  ASP/WCF, C#, MySql, ADO.Net, Networked Conferencing, chat room techniques, E-Book, Database, TCP/IP, front-end/back-end development, language localization, and plug and play networking.</p> <p class=\"tab\"><span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.attn}}</span>, thank you for taking the time to read and consider my cover letter for employment with <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.name}}</span>.

The plant identification algorithm is based on a dichotomous key that associates genetic taxonomy and leaf shape morphology. The functionality of this application is dependent on both a camera image input and a person's sense of sight and feel.

This application is not dependent on Internet signals. There is an additional celestial navigation modular component feature which is  currently under construction, which will be added as a plugin. Development of my GPS application skills includes: HTML, JavaScript, serial COM Port interface, object oriented VB.Net, and GPS serial string parsing.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The interactive tablet E-Book, book library database,  web conferencing app is a social prayer/meditation application which serves as an e-book library, LAN chat room and forum, interactive touch screen tablet, and teleconferencing tool. This device is plug and play, provided that a dedicated server is actively online on a shared network. Multiple users can log in and out in a shared event experience and influence each others' experience by changing the environment content.

The plant identification algorithm is based on a dichotomous key that associates genetic taxonomy and leaf shape morphology. The functionality of this application is dependent on both a camera image input and a person's sense of sight and feel. I used the following skills in developing my plant identification application: C#, Sql, MySql Database, plant biology taxonomy, image detection, EmguCV, front-end/back-end software development, and user interface design.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The tablet GPS app I developed is a cross-platform mobile device which inputs GPS signals from a USB COM port and displays the users current position, altitude, and speed. This application is not dependent on Internet signals. There is an additional celestial navigation modular component feature which is  currently under construction, which will be added as a plugin. Development of my GPS application skills includes: HTML, JavaScript, serial COM Port interface, object oriented VB.Net, and GPS serial string parsing.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The interactive tablet E-Book, book library database,  web conferencing app is a social prayer/meditation application which serves as an e-book library, LAN chat room and forum, interactive touch screen tablet, and teleconferencing tool. This device is plug and play, provided that a dedicated server is actively online on a shared network. Multiple users can log in and out in a shared event experience and influence each others' experience by changing the environment content. This App uses  ASP/WCF, C#, MySql, ADO.Net, Networked Conferencing, chat room techniques, E-Book, Database, TCP/IP, front-end/back-end development, language localization, and plug and play networking.</p> <p class=\"tab\"><span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.attn}}</span>, thank you for taking the time to read and consider my cover letter for employment with <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.name}}</span>.

I posses  the adaptability to apply the skills needed to work as a <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.jobname}}</span> within <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.name}}</span>.</p> <p class=\"tab\">Within the last year I have developed the following technology applications: a plant identification and imaging identification application, a Windows 8-10 tablet satellite global positioning system without wi-fi app, and an interactive tablet e-Book with an independent serve library database and  A web conferencing app. These projects were an opportunity to express my understanding and ability to perform a variety of different philosophical approaches, intellectual processes, and techniques which have value in a variety of technical markets.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The Plant Identification and Imaging Identification Assistant is a Windows OS application that performs comprehensive plant identification that is based upon human observations and traits of a plant specimen. The plant identification algorithm is based on a dichotomous key that associates genetic taxonomy and leaf shape morphology. The functionality of this application is dependent on both a camera image input and a person's sense of sight and feel. I used the following skills in developing my plant identification application: C#, Sql, MySql Database, plant biology taxonomy, image detection, EmguCV, front-end/back-end software development, and user interface design.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The tablet GPS app I developed is a cross-platform mobile device which inputs GPS signals from a USB COM port and displays the users current position, altitude, and speed. This application is not dependent on Internet signals. There is an additional celestial navigation modular component feature which is  currently under construction, which will be added as a plugin. Development of my GPS application skills includes: HTML, JavaScript, serial COM Port interface, object oriented VB.Net, and GPS serial string parsing.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The interactive tablet E-Book, book library database,  web conferencing app is a social prayer/meditation application which serves as an e-book library, LAN chat room and forum, interactive touch screen tablet, and teleconferencing tool. This device is plug and play, provided that a dedicated server is actively online on a shared network. Multiple users can log in and out in a shared event experience and influence each others' experience by changing the environment content. This App uses  ASP/WCF, C#, MySql, ADO.Net, Networked Conferencing, chat room techniques, E-Book, Database, TCP/IP, front-end/back-end development, language localization, and plug and play networking.</p> <p class=\"tab\"><span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.attn}}</span>, thank you for taking the time to read and consider my cover letter for employment with <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.name}}</span>.

I posses  the adaptability to apply the skills needed to work as a <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.jobname}}</span> within <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.name}}</span>.</p> <p class=\"tab\">Within the last year I have developed the following technology applications: a plant identification and imaging identification application, a Windows 8-10 tablet satellite global positioning system without wi-fi app, and an interactive tablet e-Book with an independent serve library database and  A web conferencing app. These projects were an opportunity to express my understanding and ability to perform a variety of different philosophical approaches, intellectual processes, and techniques which have value in a variety of technical markets.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The Plant Identification and Imaging Identification Assistant is a Windows OS application that performs comprehensive plant identification that is based upon human observations and traits of a plant specimen. The plant identification algorithm is based on a dichotomous key that associates genetic taxonomy and leaf shape morphology. The functionality of this application is dependent on both a camera image input and a person's sense of sight and feel. I used the following skills in developing my plant identification application: C#, Sql, MySql Database, plant biology taxonomy, image detection, EmguCV, front-end/back-end software development, and user interface design.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The tablet GPS app I developed is a cross-platform mobile device which inputs GPS signals from a USB COM port and displays the users current position, altitude, and speed. This application is not dependent on Internet signals. There is an additional celestial navigation modular component feature which is  currently under construction, which will be added as a plugin. Development of my GPS application skills includes: HTML, JavaScript, serial COM Port interface, object oriented VB.Net, and GPS serial string parsing.</p> <p class=\"tab\">The interactive tablet E-Book, book library database,  web conferencing app is a social prayer/meditation application which serves as an e-book library, LAN chat room and forum, interactive touch screen tablet, and teleconferencing tool. This device is plug and play, provided that a dedicated server is actively online on a shared network. Multiple users can log in and out in a shared event experience and influence each others' experience by changing the environment content. This App uses  ASP/WCF, C#, MySql, ADO.Net, Networked Conferencing, chat room techniques, E-Book, Database, TCP/IP, front-end/back-end development, language localization, and plug and play networking.</p> <p class=\"tab\"><span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.attn}}</span>, thank you for taking the time to read and consider my cover letter for employment with <span class=\"highlighterDiv\">{{audience.name}}</span>.
