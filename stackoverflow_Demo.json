Today we operate several automotive accessory and performance websites, with dedicated sales and support for each product line.</p>\r\n<p>Our roots go back to the 90’s when several of us were manufacturing and selling running boards to truck accessory shops and new car dealerships.  We soon realized that the end user was paying far too much for our product by going through all of those distribution channels.  We believed that we could cut out the middle man and save the retail customer a tremendous amount of money.  That’s when RealTruck and Auto Customs were born.</p>\r\n<p>Our mission is simple.  We exist to provide world class customer service and a cutting edge buying experience to our customers.  How we accomplish this is by understanding our products and how they help fit our customer’s needs better than anyone else.  If we don’t know it, we won’t sell it.  We also take advantage of the latest technology which allows us to display to our customers everything they need to make a well-informed buying decision.</p></div>\n</div>"
